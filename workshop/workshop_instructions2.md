# Workflow 2: CD workflow - Deploy to GitHub Pages

In this workflow we will be focusing on creating a CD workflow. At the end of the exercise we will learn - 

1. Downloading artifacts from GitHub Packages
2. Using deploy Action from Marketplace
3. Environments secrets and approvals
4. Using environments in the workflow

## Build and deploy to int environment for testing

For int environment, we will be building the source and deploying to GitHub Pages in the same repo.

1. We can enhance the same workflow file by renaming it to `ci-cd.yml`.

2. Add a new job `build-and-deploy-int`to run on `ubuntu-latest` and add the following steps - 
   - Checkout the repository
   - Install and Build for node
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages by searching for an Action from Marketplace. 
      - We will be using JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action. This action will help in deploying the build folder we specify to a branch we mention.
   
   You can use the following yml snippet -

```yaml

build-and-deploy-int:
    name: Deploy int environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout 
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.1
      - name: Install and Build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
      - name: Deploy 
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.0
        with:
          BRANCH: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          FOLDER: build # The folder the action should deploy.

```

3. Enable `GitHub Pages` settings
   - Go to `Settings` in your repository and click on `Pages`
   - Please ensure that you have chosen `gh-pages` branch and `/(root)` folder. Press save. The settings should like below -

  You will find the url where the app will get deployed. It will be - https://<username>.github.io/actions-workshop/
  ðŸŽ‰ Open the url and you will find that your app has been deployed to the int environment -

## Download artifact from GitHub Packages and deploy to staging 

For staging environment, we will create a new public repository and publish a branch from this to GitHub Pages to simulate a separate stage environment.

1. Create a new public repository `actions-demo-staging` in your user account
   - Click on your profile icon on top right corner and open `Your repositories`
   - Press `New` to create a new repository
   - Provide the repo name as `actions-demo-staging`
   - Ensure to choose `Public`
   - Leave rest options as default and click `Create repository`

2. Create a PAT for access to this repository 
   - Again go click your profile icon on top right
   - Go to `Settings`
   - Now click on `Developer Settings` from the options listed on the left side
   - Inside Developer Settings, click on `Personal access tokens`
   - Press `Generate new token`
   - Check mark only `public_repo` scope.
   - Add a note in the text box provided and click `Generate token`
   <img width="655" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25735209/111993769-02bae200-8b3d-11eb-83e8-84402b0f8102.png">
   
   Keep this tab open or copy the generated token to a safe place. we will be using this token to add a secret in the next step

3. Create staging environment in `actions-workshop` repository
   - Go back to 'Your repositories' from your profile icon and open the `actions-workshop` repository
   - Open `Settings` tab -> open `Environments`
   - Click on `New environment`
   - Give Name as `staging` and press `Configure environment`
   - Checkmark `Required reviewers` and add your username. Click `Save protection rules`
   - Under `Environment secrets`, click `Add secret`
   - Name your secret `TOKEN`
   - Add the PAT token generated in previous step in the the secret value and click on 'Add secret'
   
   This is how the environment setting should look -

4. Add a job to deploy to the staging environment
   Go to Code and open `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and edit it. Add a job to deploy to staging `deploy-staging` 
   - Ensure that this job runs only after `upload-artifact` and `build-and-deploy-int` have completed using `needs`. 
   - Use the `staging` environment for this job
   - In the steps 
      - Checkout the repo
      - Download the artifact we uploaded to GitHub Packges in CI workflow
      - Deploy to GitHub Pages for the 
        - `actions-demo-staging` repository
        - `build` folder
        - `gh-pages` branch
        -  Provide `token` from `Environment secrets`
   
   Add the following job snippet to the workflow file -
  ðŸ’¡Replace <username> with your username 
   
  ```yaml
  deploy-staging:
    name: Deploy to Staging
    needs: [upload-artifact, build-and-deploy-int]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.1
        
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: my-artifact
          path: build/
 
      - name: Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.0
        with:
          BRANCH: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          FOLDER: build # The folder the action should deploy.
          token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
          repository-name: <username>/actions-demo-staging
   ```
   
   <Following is the complete workflow file content till now>
   
   5. After you commit the above workflow to `main` check the GitHub pages setting in the `actions-demo-staging` repository and open the site - <> to see your app deployed
    
## See your Workflow in Action!! :tada:

1. Commit a change to `src\App.js`
2. Go to Actions and open the CI-CD workflow
3. Open the latest run to see the details
4. Once the workflow succeeds, go to the GitHub Pages site to see your changes- <>

<Following is the complete workflow file content>
   
## Additional Exercise - Deploy to Prod

Repeat the 'Deploy to staging' to deoply to production
1. Create a new environment for `prod`
2. Use a new public repo, simulating as prod environment
   
   
## Cleanup - Delete the PAT after the exercise

- Click on your profile icon -> `Settings` -> `Developer Settings` -> `Personal access tokens`
- Delete the Public_repo token created for this workflow.
